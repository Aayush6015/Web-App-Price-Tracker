"# Web-App-Price-Tracker" <br>
You can change the given link for the database to your own database by pasting the "connection string" in the app.py file and scheduler.py file.<br>
To run the code, first run the scheduler.py in terminal and then run the app.py in another terminal. <br>
By opening the link showing in the terminal after running app.py, one can see the webpage with input fields for Item Name and Item URL.<br>
There are still some functionalities that I want to add, like sending notification of price drop of item, having a seperate database for each user, user authentication, use of redis to make things faster.<br>

*This project is still not completed.*
